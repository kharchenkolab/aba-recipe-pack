# Model Bacterial Growth Dynamics

Distilled from a biomni implementation. In ABA, implement with the tools below — not biomni.

## Approach
1. Define the ODE: `dN/dt = r * N * (1 - N/K) - c * N` where r = growth rate, K = niche size (carrying capacity), c = clearance rate.
2. Solve with `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` using the RK45 method over the specified time span with the given time step.
3. Extract time points and population trajectory from the solution.
4. Compute: max population, final population, and steady-state check (< 1% change over last 10% of simulation).
5. Save `{Time (hours), Population Size}` DataFrame to CSV.
6. Return a log with initial conditions, results summary, and CSV path.

## Key decisions
- Net effective growth = r − c; population declines to zero if clearance exceeds growth rate.
- Steady-state is defined as < 1% fractional change between 90% and 100% of simulation time.

## Caveats
- Single-compartment deterministic model; does not capture spatial heterogeneity or stochastic extinction at low counts.
- Does not model antibiotic pharmacokinetics; for drug effects, add an explicit kill term.

## In ABA
Implement with `run_python`; `ensure_capability(["scipy", "numpy", "pandas"])`. Original impl: `source` -> lift to lakeFS later.
