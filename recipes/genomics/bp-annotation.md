description: Best-practice scRNA-seq cell-type annotation — manual marker-gene assignment, automated classification (CellTypist), and reference label transfer (scArches/scANVI), per the Single-cell Best Practices book.
when_to_use: Use this for the cell-type annotation STAGE — assigning identities to clusters by combining manual marker-gene validation, automated classification (CellTypist), and reference label transfer (scArches/scANVI), treating automated calls as a starting point. For a quick end-to-end first pass that just emits cluster markers use scrna-qc-clustering; for the full rigorous flow see the scrna-best-practices index.

# scRNA-seq cell-type annotation (best practice)

Assign biological identities to clusters/cells. The book pairs **automated prediction** (fast,
scalable) with **manual marker validation** (transparent) and warns automated calls are a
*starting point*. Annotate **coarse -> fine** iteratively.

**Provision:** `ensure_capability(["scanpy","anndata","celltypist"])`.

## 1. Manual marker-gene annotation (always do this to validate)
```python
import scanpy as sc
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, "leiden", method="wilcoxon")
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot(adata, n_genes=5, save="_markers.png")

# check a known marker dictionary as a dotplot
markers = {"T cell": ["CD3D","CD3E"], "B cell": ["CD79A","MS4A1"],
           "Mono": ["CD14","LYZ"], "NK": ["NKG7","GNLY"]}
sc.pl.dotplot(adata, markers, groupby="leiden", standard_scale="var")

# per-cell signature scores for a marker set
sc.tl.score_genes(adata, markers["T cell"], score_name="T_score")
```
Map clusters to types from the dotplot, then write labels into `adata.obs["cell_type"]`.
Cluster-level annotation is more robust than per-cell, given marker sparsity/dropout.

## 2. Automated classification — CellTypist
Pre-trained logistic models with multiple resolutions + majority voting.
```python
import celltypist
# CellTypist expects CP10k + log1p input
adata_ct = adata.copy()
sc.pp.normalize_total(adata_ct, target_sum=1e4); sc.pp.log1p(adata_ct)
pred = celltypist.annotate(adata_ct, model="Immune_All_Low.pkl", majority_voting=True)
adata.obs["celltypist"] = pred.predicted_labels["majority_voting"].values
adata.obs["celltypist_conf"] = pred.predicted_labels["conf_score"].values
```
Cross-check `celltypist` labels against the marker dotplot before trusting them.

## 3. Reference label transfer — scArches / scANVI
Map your query onto an annotated reference; transfers labels WITH uncertainty.
```python
# requires RAW counts and the query genes aligned to the reference feature order
# model = sca.models.SCANVI.load_query_data(adata_query, ref_model)
# model.train(max_epochs=...); then weighted_knn_transfer for labels + uncertainty
```
See **`scvi-label-transfer-scanvi`** for ABA's ready scANVI/scArches path. Set an uncertainty
threshold (book uses >0.2 -> "Unknown").

## Pitfalls the book calls out
- **Automated = starting point**, not truth. Always validate against markers; inspect dendrograms.
- **Input format matters**: CellTypist wants CP10k+log1p; scArches/scANVI want **raw counts** with
  genes in the reference's order.
- **Annotate progressively** — coarse lineages first, then subtypes via sub-clustering.
- **Batch effects** distort markers/transfer; integrate first (`bp-data-integration`) and prefer
  references built across datasets.

## In ABA
ABA also ships **`annotate-celltype-scrna`** and **`annotate-celltype-with-panhumanpy`** for
turnkey annotation, and **`unsupervised-celltype-transfer-between-scrna-datasets`** for transfer.
Annotated labels feed condition analyses: **`bp-differential-expression`**,
**`bp-compositional-analysis`**, **`bp-gsea-pathway`**.

Once annotated, write a viewer-optimized store from the in-memory object and offer
it (opens instantly — pre-optimized, no on-launch conversion):
```python
import lstar
lstar.write(lstar.read_anndata(adata), "annotated.lstar.zarr", viewer=True)  # viewer@0.1
```
**proactively offer** `open_viewer(file_path="annotated.lstar.zarr")` and present the
returned link so the user can explore the labels on the UMAP in pagoda3 (offer it
once, after reporting the result). Keep raw counts in adata so the precomputed stats
use real counts. Format/sharing choices → **`scrna-viewing-and-interchange`**.
